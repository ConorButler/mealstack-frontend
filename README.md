# What is Mealstack?

### Mealstack is a meal planning app that aims to make planning meals convenient for the nutrition conscious and time conscious person.

### Users can create publicly accessible plans via 2 paths; creating them by selecting from recipes, or having one generated after entering their desired total macros. Users can also search all recipes using macros or dietary requirements.

### Each plan represents 3 meals for a day of eating, and shows the total macros (illustrated with a pie chart), the individual ingredients with a link to the recipe instructions, and a compounded list of shopping ingredients for all 3 meals.

### You can sign in with GitHub and save plans to your account so that you can refer back to them later. They can be deleted from this page at any point.
